# Augmented Reality Project

Augmented Reality, whose acronym is AR, is an immersive technology capable of enhancing the sensory experience of users through technological tools. In other words, this technology allows to merge real and virtual elements to intensify the user's perception of the reality.

In our specific case, we were demanded to superimpose a layer containing the course’s logo and an author’s name on top of the cover of a well-known Computer Vision book in order to appear real to the observer. In particular, the professor provided us the files:

    Input video sequence to be augmented;
    First frame of the input sequence;
    Binary mask that identifies the pixels belonging to the book in the reference frame;
    Image containing the augmented reality layer;
    Binary mask of the augmented reality layer.

In the following sections we will explain step by step how we obtained the final outcome starting from the previous files.
